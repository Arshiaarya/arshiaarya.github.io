Contributed to [DoWhy](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy), Microsoft's open-source library for causal inference.

Developed the **Dummy Outcome Refuter**, expanding the library's robustness testing capabilities. This refutation method helps researchers validate their causal estimates by testing against placebo outcomes.

Benchmarked refutation methods across synthetic and real datasets to improve reliability of causal inference pipelines.
