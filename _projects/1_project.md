HyWay ("Hybrid Hallway") is a system designed to enable mingling and informal interactions among physical and virtual users in casual spaces and settings.

In hybrid work environments, spontaneous hallway conversations and chance encounters—crucial for building relationships and sparking collaboration—are lost for remote participants. HyWay addresses this by creating porosity between physical and virtual spaces, enabling serendipitous interactions that mimic the organic mingling of in-person work.

The system was developed at Microsoft Research India and published at IMWUT 2023.
