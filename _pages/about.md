Hello, I am Arshia Arya, currently a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India. 
I work in the broad area of Computational Social Science and Human Computer Interaction. I am interested in the interaction of users with social media and the general news media in terms of online engagement, misinformation circulation and other applications.   
I will be applying for PhD for Fall'2023 and looking to interact with people working in similar domains!
